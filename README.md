**MIL Version** MIL X SP6

**Type** Example

**Description**  
This program shows how to calculate inter-packet delays for your GigE VisionÂ® camera. The resulting table printed at the end of this example can be used to program the appropriate delay in user applications using MdigControl with M_GC_INTER_PACKET_DELAY.

The project structure, including the xml, aims to be copied in "\Users\Public\Documents\Matrox Imaging\MIL\Examples\BoardSpecific\PacketDelay" of the MIL installation directory to be displayed by the MIL example launcher.
